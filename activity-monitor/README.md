## Getting started

- Install [Node LTS](https://nodejs.org)
- Clone this repository
- `cd activity-monitor`
- `npm install` to install the application's dependencies
- `npm start` to start the application

## Going further

Here are some ideas on how it can be improved using other Electron APIs.

- Make it live update every X number of seconds
- Add tooltips that show times in hours/days instead of milliseconds
- Support exporting CPU times to a comma-separated (.csv) file
- Support saving chart as PNG
- Support copying chart image to clipboard
- Add second chart of free vs. used memory
